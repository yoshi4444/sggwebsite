                    <li>This is the most important rule, have fun.</li>
                    <li>Please respect all other Guardians within the Clan, we will accept no Bullying of any sort. This is a key rule and there will be no place within the clan for this behaviour and you will be kicked.</li>
                    <li>No promotion of other Clans within Clan chat you will be warned and the next time you will be kicked.</li>
                    <li>Please help those within the clan to become better within the game as this will promote a stronger clan.</li>
                    <li>Worship the Gun.</li>
                    <li>Participate in clan activities.</li>
                    <li>If you think that there is someone who you think fits our clan ethos of having fun and enjoying the game together please let the admin team know and we will look to possibly invite said person</li>
                    <li>When in a raid no matter how frustrating things may get never Rage quit out of a raid. As Rage quitters will be given a 3 strikes and you're out policy as this looks bad on the Clan and will be detrimental to future raids.</li>
                    <li>If for some reason you get disconnected when raiding with Clan and alliance members. Please please try to get a message to someone in the raid or fire team to let them know. As otherwise it may seem to be Rage Quitting.</li>
                    <li>Please be open, honest and courteous to all in the clan. Respect others and they will respect you back.</li>
